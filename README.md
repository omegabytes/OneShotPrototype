# One Shot Prototype

## Summary
This application is a functional prototype for a tabletop RPG-style game. It is loosley modled on the Dungeons and Dragons, and uses a few D&D assets like spells/items. The goal is to provide a feel for what tabletop rpg systems of the future may play like on voice assistant devices like Alexa or Google Home.
