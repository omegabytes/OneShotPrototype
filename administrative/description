Short Description:

TableTop Pro is the next evolution of pen-and-paper RPGs.

Long Description:

TableTop Pro emulates the gameplay of classic pen-and-paper RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons with Alexa as the Dungeon Master. Choose your character, explore exciting locations, and battle fierce enemies in this short adventure.

This application is a prototype adventure system for the MindSumo Alexa game challenge. This functions as a proof-of-concept and is not fully-featured. Check back periodically as we add more locations and more advanced options!

Testing Instructions:
Open the session and follow the instructions. Say Exit to quit. There are 5 default actions that can be taken at most points: attack, investigate, flee, diplomacy, hide. Game state is stored per userID and is reset on game win/lose, or optionally when the user continues an in-progress game.
